## Nothing but a Number
#### Week 1 
This was the first attempt at visualizing my statistic. I focused on trying to use imagery to convey my message. I had trouble with these because I was not sure how to go about representing and it was my first time. I think that I made more progress during week 2 in creating more aesthetically pleasing images.
